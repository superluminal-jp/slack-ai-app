# Validate Documentation

Verify that README, CHANGELOG, API docs, and architecture docs match the current implementation.

## Steps

1. Compare README.md (structure, installation, usage) to actual project layout and scripts.
2. Check CHANGELOG.md format and that recent changes are reflected.
3. If present, validate API docs and architecture docs against code.
4. Report mismatches and suggest concrete edits.

Use `/validate-docs` to run this check.
