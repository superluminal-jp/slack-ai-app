# Output Standards

**Purpose**: Professional document creation standards. Apply invisibly — framework names never appear in delivered output.

## Core Frameworks

### Pyramid Principle (Minto, 1985)

Present top-down: conclusion first, supporting arguments, then evidence. Three rules: (1) Ideas at any level summarize ideas below them. (2) Ideas in a group are logically the same kind. (3) Ideas in a group follow logical order. Every document has one **Governing Thought** at the apex.

### MECE (Minto, 1960s)

All categorizations: no overlap (mutually exclusive), complete coverage (collectively exhaustive).

### SCQA (Minto, 1985)

**Situation** (20–30 words) → **Complication** (20–30 words) → **Question** (≤15 words) → **Answer** (30–50 words).

### BLUF (U.S. Military)

Key conclusion first. Supporting detail follows.

### Hypothesis-Driven (McKinsey)

Organize around hypotheses to test, not data to present. Apply **80/20 Rule** — prioritize 20% of analysis yielding 80% of insight.

## Language Standards

- **Plain language**: Common words, 15–20 word sentences, one idea per paragraph (Plain Language Act 2010, ISO 24495-1:2023)
- **Active voice**: "We recommend X" not "X is recommended" (Strunk & White)
- **Specificity**: "processes 1,000 items/sec" not "handles many items"
- **Readability**: Flesch-Kincaid grade 8–9, Gunning Fog <12

---

## "So What?" Test

Every assertion must survive. Transform data into insight:
- **Data**: "50% of leads converted in Q4."
- **Insight**: "Conversion dropped from 65% to 50%, indicating we lose prospects late in the cycle."

---

## Evidence & Citations

Primary sources → peer-reviewed → authoritative secondary. Citation format: APA 7 (academic), IEEE (engineering), Chicago 17 (business), ISO 690:2021 (bibliographic).

---

## Visualization

- **Tufte**: Data-ink ratio ≥0.95. No chartjunk. Lie factor 0.95–1.05.
- **Zelazny**: Component→pie/stacked bar. Item→horizontal bar. Time→column/line. Frequency→histogram. Correlation→scatter.
- **Cleveland-McGill**: Position > length > angle > area > color.
- **Required elements**: Action title, axis labels with SI units, source citation, legend.

---

## Document Structure

- **Executive summary**: SCQA → 3–4 MECE findings → implications → actions. Core message in 3 minutes.
- **Body**: 3–4 MECE sections. Each: conclusion first → evidence → implications.
- **Action titles**: State conclusions (~15 words with data), not topics.
- **Recommendations**: What, by whom, by when, expected outcome, resources.

---

## Quality Assurance

### Three-Stage Editing

1. **Revision**: Content accuracy, structure, logical flow
2. **Editing**: Language, sentence structure, consistency
3. **Proofreading**: Typos, formatting, final polish

Execute in strict order.

### Content Checks

- Starts with conclusion? (Pyramid)
- No overlap, complete coverage? (MECE)
- Every data point passes "So What?"
- Recommendations actionable with owner, timeline, outcome?
- Core message understood in 3 minutes?

### Output Language

**Never** include: "Pyramid Principle," "MECE," "SCQA," "So What?," "hypothesis-driven," or framework names. Use natural business language.
