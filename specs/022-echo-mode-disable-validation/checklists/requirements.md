# Specification Quality Checklist: Echo Mode Disable — Full Pipeline Validation with TDD

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items passed validation on first iteration
- Spec references environment variable name `VALIDATION_ZONE_ECHO_MODE` as contextual identifier (not implementation detail) since it is an existing, deployed configuration parameter
- TDD requirement (FR-006) is a process requirement rather than a functional one; its verification is through SC-003 (commit history)
- AWS best practices application details will be elaborated in the planning phase using MCP servers
